Orenco FLL Parents,

The Oregon FIRST LEGO League qualifying tournaments are just around the corner! This email contains useful information about what to expect during the day of the tournament. If you have any questions that may need to be asked outside of that forum please contact your child’s coach or Mrs. Beale directly. We’re looking forward to competing in this year’s tournament!

##Tournament Information

###When & Where

Intel, Jones Farm Conference Center, 2111 Northeast 25th Avenue, Hillsboro, OR
8 AM Check In
9 AM Opening Ceremony

The coaches will be on site by 8 AM promptly to establish our space in The Pit and process our paperwork. All teammates should arrive no later than 8:15 AM.

####Day Of

The teams won't know their specific schedule (when each challenge / judging session happens) until the morning of the tournament when we pick up our packets. That information will be sent out to the parents as soon as we have it. This brings us to tournament day communication.

###Tournament Communication

During most of the tournament the team will be away from parents either in The Pit, in one of the judging rooms, in the presentation room, or on stage participating in the robot challenge. While parents are allowed to witness the presentation (in the presentation room) and the robot challenge (on stage in the auditorium) they are not allowed to enter The Pit or the other judging rooms. To make sure that parents have a way to stay up to date as well as reach their child in an emergency we have set up multiple modes of communication.

####Twitter

The coaches will be posting photos, observations, scores, and general updates throughout the tournament to one of two team Twitter feeds. As we're posting photos of the kids these feeds are private and require that followers be approved prior to seeing the feed. Both coaches have already set up the accounts and we encourage you to request following the feeds now. (Note, parents of either team are welcome to follow both team feeds).

The N.A.R.W.H.A.Ls., @OrencoNARHWALS, 22337@orencorobotics.net
Robo P.U.G.S., @RoboPugs14025, 14025@orencorobotics.net

If you're new to twitter and need help setting up an account please see either Coach Beale or Coach KT at the end one of the upcoming team meetings and we'll be happy to assist.

####Direct Line

In the event of an *emergency* you may contact the coaches or Mrs. Beale directly using the contact information below. Please note that during the tournament everyone is VERY busy. This line of communication should only be used in the case of a health or family emergency.

Mrs. Beale - 503.332.7186
Coach Beale - 503.914.8317
Coach KT, 703.634.9786

If you need to contact us, please contact Mrs. Beale first.

####Liaison

This year Mrs. Beale will be able periodically check in with parents who are on site in the Auditorium. Questions about team progress, schedule updates, etc can be addressed at this time.

###Judging and Tournament Goals

Competing in the FLL Tournament is a great experience for the team. During the entire day the kids operate autonomously and are responsible for schedule, logistics, and team management. Coaches are strongly discouraged from leading the team or solving problems at this time (in past events coach intervention could lead to team disqualification). For many of the team members this will be the first time they operate with this level of responsibility and freedom. Further, while each team has the higher goal of passing on to the state competition true success is measured differently. Many think of FLL as a "robot club" but the truth is the purpose of this exercise is much larger than learning to build and code a LEGO robot which has limited application later in life. The larger purpose is to teach the kids to think like an engineer: that is, learning to work as a team to break large problems into smaller ones.  During this season the teams have worked on complex challenges related to research, project delivery, design, team dynamics, and lastly robotics. Success is measured in what the kids learned and to that end FLL judging is quite comprehensive and the metrics used to evaluate each team often have little to do with robot performance. Attached to this message is a copy of the FLL Judging Rubric. We encourage you to read through this document and to speak with your student after the event to discuss what they really learned.

Also attached to this email are copies of a parent letter from ORTOP, FLL, and Intel. Please take a moment to read through these letters.

If you have any questions please bring them with you to the Parent and Team meeting this Sunday at 4 PM.

Thank you again for supporting the Orenco Robotics Team! We hope that this experience has been worthwhile for each of the students and look forward to a successful tournament!

Mrs. Beale, Coach Beale, Coach KT

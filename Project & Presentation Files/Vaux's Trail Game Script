Host: (pointing) And team 3, are you ready?

Team 3 (a.k.a. judges) Yes!

Host: Excellent! Let's play! Question number 1. What type of habitat loss are swifts currently facing?

<PRESS 1> ANSWER: DEFORESTATION: SWIFTS DEPEND ON TALL, HOLLOW TREE TO REST IN DURING THEIR ROUGHLY 6 THOUSAND MILE MIGRATION.

Host: Question number 2.  Why do swifts pack together at night?

<PRESS 2> ANSWER: TO KEEP WARM: SWIFTS' FEATHERS ARE BUILD FOR SPEED AND LACK ANY SIGNIFICANT INSULATION NEEDED TO KEEP WARM.

Host: Question number 3. Why do swifts tend to roost in chimneys?

<PRESS 3> ANSWER: REPLICATES LARGE HOLLOW TREES: SWIFTS ARE A CLINGING BIRD THAT CAN USE THE INSIDE OF CHIMNEYS. CLOSED BOTTOMS AND NARROW OPENINGS PROTECT THEM FROM PREDATORS AND INCLEMENT WEATHER.

Host: Question number 4. Name a predator that prey on swifts.

<PRESS 4> ANSWER: CROWS, OWLS, and FALCONS, OH MY: VAUX'S SWIFTS LACK DEFENSES NEEDED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM BIRDS OF PREY AND OPPORTUNISTIC RODENTS. DURING MIGRATION THESE SMALL BIRDS RELY ON THEIR SPEED AND NUMBERS FOR SAFTEY.

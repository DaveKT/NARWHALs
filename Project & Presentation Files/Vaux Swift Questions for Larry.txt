Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? 

Do you consider yourself to be a scientist, envorinmentalts, nature advocate, etc? How do your effort contribute to the large goal or preserving habitiat and swift populations?

What can you share with us regarding natural habitat loss? Are there areas along the migration route that are more affected than others? Are there natural areas that have the same kind of traffic that we see at the Chapman school?

Do you know of any other preservation operations to protect the Vaux Swift migration route? We're aware of the Aududon society's efforts to get help the Vaux... are there other organizations helping the animals?

What is the largest problem, in your opinion, facing migrating Vaux's with regards to habitat?

Do you particapte in or are you aware of public awareness campaigns? What about homeowner chimneys? Can you tell us how your work contrubites to the habitat preservation effort? 

Can we (humans) invent habitat for the swifts that are less like chimneys and more like hollow trees? Could those be placed in parks? Are there better man made habitats for migrating swifts than chimneys?

What do we do with displaced animals? (Thinking of the J.B. Thomas school incident here.)

Can we better incorporate the environment into our construction / city planning? Are there efforts to protect environments where we know Swifts migrate?

Are Vaux Swifts endangered? Are there populations recovering?

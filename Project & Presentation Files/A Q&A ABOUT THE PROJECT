A Q&A ABOUT THE PROJECT


what problem are we trying to solve? answer: vaux's swifts are running out of space, food, and are being uncared for by conservationists
(on the national conservation list, it is on the edge of being cared about, but it is already in low numbers.)

why did we choose swifts over other animal-human interactions? answer: we chose Vaux's swifts because they are local, in need of help, and after all, the are pretty cute up close! ( And really fluffy!)

which sources were used to determine the problem? answer: larry shwitters, an expert in the study of the vaux's swift, and a conservationalists to boot!

what do vaux's swifts face during migration? answer: wired chimneys, not enough living space and food, and mad people who don't want a bunch of birds in their heating sources!

how large is the current vaux swift population? answer: according to vauxhappening.org, there are around 340,000 although declining fast

has your idea been tried before if so, how has your solution improved upon the current plan? answer: our solution will improve upon the current design in numerous ways, for one, it will have a heating pad for the swifts, along with heat-absorbing materials, a heat loss resistant design, and anti-predator defenses.

why is the design the shape it is? what are its benifits? answer: the circle design is more heat retentious, can hold more swifts,and is earthquake proof. 

what other benifits does your design display? answer: a poop/dead bird collector, so farmers can have it for fertilizer, and scientists can use it as a specimin.

How tall will the actual roost be? answer: around 10 feet

how much will the total cost be? answer: an estimate would be around 4000-5000 dollars for the lumber and 100-200 for the defenses and heating element.

where will these be placed answer: along the migration routes.

are there any laws against setting these up? answer: no, there are not, but you do need permission to build.
